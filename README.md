I'm sure there's many MC Bots out there... but this one is homebrewed to perfection.

This bot comes with some example scripts that can do basic functions.

This bot can also run custom scripts that you write.

This bot obviously isn't quite there yet - you needa wait a bit for the phresh cake.

This bot can treat you like an insider - you just gotta clone, compile and run. But be warned: this bot is pretty stupid.

The API is constantly evolving in this `0.y.x` time, so don't expect a script you make today to be valid and functional tomorrow!
